Research on Political Semantic Change Based on Similarity 						 2021
•	Texts of People's Daily from 1957 to 2002 were extracted, and the texts from 1969 to 1982 were chosen as the test data. A model was built to get the similar words of the key word. The similar words were used as features to track the semantic change of the key word. For example, around 1972, the keyword “the United States” lost the feature of “imperialism”, which is consistent with historical facts.
PPMI Practice 												 2021
•	The PPMI model was established with the dataset to explore the advantages and disadvantages of word frequency and PPMI. It was found that the frequency of words co-occurrence does not offer much information while PPMI can potently show the co-occurrence words with special semantic meaning.
